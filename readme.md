How to run it

Instructions:

The following exercise contains two user stories for you to implement (and a third one that you shouldn't worry about for now). Each user story relies on the previous one. Your goal is to have a working program in the language of your choice that implements these use cases.

You can assume the input is valid. You don't need to handle unexpected characters or invalid spacing in the input file.

Guidelines:

We value clean code and good object oriented design.

By clean code we mean:

Concise and descriptive variable and method names.
Good use of the programming language.
Easy to read.
a README (run/compile instructions)
By good design we mean:

Object oriented design principles. ( e.g. SOLID)
Good separation of concerns.
A simple, practical solution.
Mostly we are interested in code that makes you proud.

If you could add some tests as well, that would really be icing on the cake.

1. Download the project from Github
2. Open View->Tools Windows->Terminal and run sbt assembly
